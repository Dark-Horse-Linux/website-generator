description = Not enough freedom?  DHLP has you covered:  Pyrois is a project that automates the compilation of a Linux distribution of your own, based largely on the <a href="">Linux From Scratch</a> documentation.  It compiles an entire system from raw component sources, and is designed in such a way that you can kick off your own custom distribution easily and start fresh with any kind of modifications you can integrate, with a resulting system that you can gaurantee full chain of custody over from raw source to production.  Enjoy a non-GMO, no-preservative diet of verifiably pure, untouched Linux.  Dark Horse Linux was built using Pyrois.  Good luck!
