description = Rex is a capable automation system that loads potentially long chains of executables written in any language, and executes them as a workflow in a similar manner to many build systems, with the benefit of creating detailed log captures of what it executes in a highly organized manner.  It provides safety rails around chains of automations potentially provided by disparate sources.  Rex is the core tool used by the Pyrois project to compile Dark Horse Linux.
